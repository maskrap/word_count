# _Word Count_

#### By **Sam Park**

## Objectives
Create a website that uses a method to return how frequently a word appears in a given string. The user should be able to input both the word and the string of words to check.

Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:

* Specs have complete coverage for the behaviors that need to be tested.
* Specs are passing.
* Logic is easy to understand.
* Code has proper indentation and spacing.
* Variable names are descriptive.
* Integration specs are passing.
* Sinatra application uses views, instance variables and forms.
* Good Git documentation (regular commits with clear, consistently formatted messages and a complete README).
* Message syntax should complete the sentence "This commit will..."; for example "update image files on the home page".
* README should include application name, author name, description, setup instructions, licensing.
* Application is deployed to Heroku (include the link in your README).
* Discuss the flow of your code and the concepts behind it with an instructor using correct terminology.

## Specifications
